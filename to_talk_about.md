# Topic for group meet

## What have been done

- Project structure (what, where, how, why)

- Spinlock mutex/Barrier
  - Ref?
  - Design explanation.
  - Valdation and perf test explanation

## What need to be done next

1. Finish concurrent counter

- implementation
- validation test
- performance test

2. Get performance test data from >3 share-memory system

3. Write report

- Concentrate on "perform performance/scalability study for x"
    -> How x performance changes when more thread is added
  - Depend on external factor (scheduler), so complicated, see ref for possible explanation

- Chart all the data and provide comment/explanation
